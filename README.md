##  WWDC23 Swift Student Challenge Submission
# Leo's Adventure - A journey through the roots of samba

This is my submission for the WWDC23 Swift Student Challenge. It's an interactive game designed for children that explores a traditional brazilian musical rhythm 'samba de roda'. The game is based on the different instruments and sounds that make up the rhythm, while also giving a historical background of the importance of Samba for brazilian people. The game is designed for iPad with iOS 16 and up. The use of headphones is recommended for the best sound experience. If you wish to run the app on an xcode simulator with headphones, don't forget to change the audio output to your external headphones from the simulator screen (I/O -> Audio Output -> External Headphones).

## Technologies Used
`SwiftUI` `AVFoundation` `AVFAudio`

## Assets
The design of the game was thought of and developed by me (Gustavo Sacramento Santos) with the help of open source images and sounds. The music was created by me using GarageBand presets and free samples from the sample library Splice. The visual aspect of the game was made on Figma with free vectors from FreePik, along with free open source components from the Figma Community. The font is a free font from DaFont called "Bonocô" created by the graphic designer Fernando PJ,  inspired by the work of popular letter painters in the city of Salvador (Bahia, Brazil). The specific licenses for each sound used are in the 'Splice Licenses' folder of the project.
